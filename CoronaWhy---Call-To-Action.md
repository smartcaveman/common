## Invitation To Participate
COVID-19 is the most disruptive phenomenon of our time. The pandemic has profound medical, societal and economical consequences. 

There are massive amounts of COVID-19 data, but pulling critical knowledge from that data and turning it into actionable intelligence is a momentous task. It’s easy for vital data to get missed, or for isolated teams to waste time on the same work. Public organizations are urgently calling for help to support current research. 

This is where CoronaWhy fits in. CoronaWhy is a volunteer organization with almost 300 volunteers globally with diverse expertise in ML and AI, but a single mission: to take the most pressing questions, collect all relevant data, find answers and get them to those who can put them to best effect. 

We're looking for volunteers, partners and sponsors who can help us in a range of ways including:
* Sourcing, collecting, formatting and analyzing data
* Coordinating, organizing and managing our volunteer teams
* Providing computational resources
* Helping connect to and liaise with key organizations that can help or benefit from our work
* Help raise awareness of CoronaWhy’s efforts through personal and professional networks or media
* Helping us collect, prepare and present findings to the public and relevant agencies.
* Scientific supervision of the projects (i.e. Covid-19 risk factor analysis)

Let’s unite our efforts in a fight against COVID-19 to overcome it as fast as possible!
