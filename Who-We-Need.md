* Non-technical talent (project managers etc)
* Experienced problem formulators & solvers, we are severely understaffed with people who can take unstructured information and transform it into the actionable task
* People with experience in medical domains (virology, epidemics, biology)
* Cross-discipline operators (people that work on the intersection of different subject domains like technology + medicine)
* Researchers & principal investigators, traditional academic background that are familiar with the process
* Marketers & Communicators (we, as a group, need to more effectively spread our core message and mission to organizations that can help us)
* Data engineers (there is a lot of data and we need to preprocess and enrich it)
* Developers (we still need to build traditional non-AI systems to help ML pipeline)
